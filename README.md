# Rock 'em sock 'em! - Simple boxing game
Just a simple videogame I developed in my free time. The objective was that to refresh my knowledge of Java and better learn some JavaFX functionalities.

### Remarkable features
The damage the player is dealt at each turn is calculated to be greater if he didn't manage to throw a good "punch" to the opponent.
Obviously, if the player is able to achieve a critical hit, the opponent will deal close to zero damage or no damage at all.
In order to not have a totally predictable output, some randomness is applied to the damage calculation.

### Future development
I don't plan on further develop this simple game. Should I ever do this, I would surely improve graphics and the damage algorithm.
